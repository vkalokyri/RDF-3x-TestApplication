# RDF-3x-TestApplication

The main purpose of this project is the familiarization and the evaluation of the RDF-3X (RDF- Triple Express) engine, an engine which manages scalable RDF data and achieves excellent performance, outperforming the previously best RDF systems.
For evaluating the performance of RDF-3X, we used two large datasets with different characteristics and compared the query run-times. All experiments were conducted on DELL PC with a Core 2 Quad processor, 4 GBytes of memory, and running a 64-bit Linux Ubuntu OS. We repeated all queries five times and took the mean value of them in order to avoid artifacts caused by OS activity.
